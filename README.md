This app serves as a personal book tracker where you can manage your collection by adding, updating, or deleting books. It features a scrollable "bookshelf" of daily recommendations hosted by [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) as well as an interactive table to manage personal book preferences.
